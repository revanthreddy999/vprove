# Wipu â€” React + Tailwind (Vite)

A lightweight, easy-to-remodel starter built in Canvas style: React + Tailwind, modular sections, and simple routing.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Customize

- Colors: see `tailwind.config.js` (`brand` palette) and utility classes in components.
- Pages/sections: edit files in `src/pages` and `src/components`.
- Routing: configured in `src/main.jsx` with `react-router-dom`.

## Deploy

- Netlify/Vercel: drag & drop the `dist` folder after `npm run build`.
- GoDaddy cPanel/static hosting: upload `dist` to your public web root.
